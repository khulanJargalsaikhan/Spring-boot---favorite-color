-----------

Using  SpringBoot and all the knowledge you have so far acquired you shall now create an application that displays a form. The form shall prompt the user to answer three questions as follows:

Question 1: What is your Name?

Question 2: What is your Quest?

Question 3: Either "What is your favorite color?" or "What is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?"

Question 3 will randomly ask either of it's questions so there will only be one question 3 displayed.

You must display a picture of a knight on the question page.

Once the user enters the answers to the questions, they shall click a button labeled "Answer" and be directed to to a page that says "You are ______ and your quest is ______. You may proceed across the Bridge!

You must also display an image of a bridge on the confirmation page.
